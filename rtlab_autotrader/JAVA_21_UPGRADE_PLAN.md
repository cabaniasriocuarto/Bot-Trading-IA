# Java 21 LTS Upgrade Plan

Goal: Upgrade any Java runtime usage in this repository to Java 21 (LTS) and update CI/docker/build configs.

Current repo scan: no `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` files were detected. If this project contains Java modules elsewhere, point me to them and I'll adapt the plan.

Planned steps
1. Inventory
   - Locate all Java modules, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, Dockerfiles, and CI workflows that set a Java version.
   - Search for images or base images using older JDKs (e.g., `adoptopenjdk`, `eclipse-temurin:8/11/17`).

2. Update build configs
   - Maven: set `maven.compiler.source` and `maven.compiler.target` to `21` and update `maven-compiler-plugin` if required.
   - Gradle: set `java.toolchain.languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(21)` or `sourceCompatibility = '21'` and `targetCompatibility = '21'` for older builds.
   - Dockerfiles: change base images to a Java 21 image (recommended: `eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-jammy` or `bellsoft/liberica-openjdk:21` depending on needs).

3. Update CI/CD
   - GitHub Actions: use `actions/setup-java@v4` with `distribution: 'temurin'` and `java-version: '21'` (or `java: '21'` depending on action).
   - Docker-based pipelines: update builder and runtime images to Java 21.

4. Tooling and local dev
   - Document `JAVA_HOME` and local toolchain instructions for developers.
   - Suggest installing Java 21 via SDKMAN or OS packages; example for Windows: use Eclipse Temurin installer or `choco install temurin21jdk`.

5. Tests and validation
   - Run unit/integration tests and fix compilation/dep issues.
   - Run static analysis and update deprecated API usages.
   - Run packaging and smoke test the produced artifacts.

6. Rollout
   - Stage rollout by environment: CI -> staging -> production.
   - Monitor logs and performance; revert plan if critical regressions.

Quick automated checklist (commands)
- Search for Java build files:

  - `git grep -n "pom.xml\|build.gradle\|openjdk\|temurin\|adoptopenjdk" || true`

- Example Dockerfile change (replace base image):

  - `FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-jammy`

- GitHub Actions snippet:

  - uses: actions/setup-java@v4
    with:
      distribution: 'temurin'
      java-version: '21'

Notes and next steps
- I didn't find Java build files in this repository during a quick scan. If you have Java modules elsewhere, tell me their paths or allow me to search the entire workspace for specific extensions.
- If you want, I can: run a full repo search for Java usages, update Dockerfiles/CI automatically, or create a PR with the changes.
